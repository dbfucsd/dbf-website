This repo is a backup/copy of the code for the dbf website hosted at https://dbf.ucsd.edu/.
Editing this repo will not actually change the live website, and the code in this repo and may not be completely up to date. This is strictly a backup in case we screw up badly with the live version.
For information on how to edit the live website please reach out to @jdweak or @schrodingerscat9010 in the dbf discord.

TODO: Pretty sure we are unable to directly connect a github repo to the live site due to firewall/network restrictions, need to confirm with ITS. -jdweak
